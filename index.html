        <h2>Daydreaming</h2>
        <p>
			Dreamers<br>
            They never learn<br>
            They never learn<br>
            Beyond the point<br>
            Of no return<br>
            Of no return<br>
            <br>
            And it’s too late<br>
            The damage is done<br>
            The damage is done<br>
            <br>
            This goes<br>
            Beyond me<br>
            Beyond you<br>
            <br>
            The white room<br>
            By a window<br>
            Where the sun comes<br>
            Through<br>
            <br>
            We are<br>
            Just happy to serve<br>
            Just happy to serve<br>

        <h2>Videotape</h2>
        <p>
			When I'm at the pearly gates<br>
			This will be on my videotape, my videotape<br>
			Mephistopheles is just beneath<br><br>
			and he's reaching up to grab me<br>
			<br>
			This is one for the good days<br>
			and i have it all here<br><br>
			In red, blue, green<br>
			Red, blue, green<br>
			<br>
			You are my center<br>
			When i spin away<br>
			Out of control on videotape<br>
			On videotape<br>
			On videotape<br><br>
			On videotape<br>
			<br>
			This is my way of saying goodbye<br>
			Because I can't do it face to face<br>
			I'm talking to you before it's too late<br>
			(From my videotape)<br>
			<br>
			No matter what happens now<br>
			You shouldn't be afraid<br>
			Because I know today has been the most perfect day I've ever seen.<br>

		<h2>Lift</h2>
		<p>
			This is the place<br>
			Sit down, you're safe now<br>
			You've been stuck in a lift<br> 
			We've been trying to reach you, Thom<br> 
			This is the place<br> 
			It won't hurt, it will not hurt<br> 
			As mell of recognition<br> 
			A face you barely loved<br> 
			Empty all your pockets<br> 
			'Cause it's time to go home<br> 
			This is the place<br> 
			Remembering all the things you always see<br> 
			You've been stuck in a lift<br> 
			In the belly of a whale<br> 
			At the bottom of the ocean<br> 
			A smell of recognition<br> 
			A face you barely loved<br> 
			Empty all your pockets<br> 
			'Cause it's time to go home<br> 
			Today is the first day of the rest of your days<br> 
			So lighten up, squirt<br>
